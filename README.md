# Photometry-Pipeline

This is a development site for building a pipeline to automatically process
and do aperture photometry on science images captured in my observatory as 
well as other observatories (iTelescope, BGO) I have access to.

Current state: First succesful run on RW AUR images captured by BGO, need
to work on iTelescope images as there's some sort of WCS issue with them.
